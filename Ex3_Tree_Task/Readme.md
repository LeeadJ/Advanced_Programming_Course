# Ex3: File Tree Printing Tool

## Overview
stree is a command-line tool designed to print a file tree with detailed information about file permissions, users, groups, and sizes. The tool traverses the directory structure starting from the current folder, displaying the hierarchy of directories and files in a tree-like format. It is developed as a solution to Task 3 of a class assignment.

Due Date: June 16, 2023.

## Features

- Displays the file tree with permissions, user and group names, and sizes.
- Supports printing the tree from the current folder and descending into subdirectories.
- Uses special characters to represent the tree structure for enhanced readability.
- Counts the number of directories and files encountered during traversal.

## Usage
To run stree, use the following command: `./stree [directory]`
If no directory is specified, the current folder will be used as the starting point.

## Example Output
The output generated by stree resembles the following format:
├── [drwxr-xr-x] username groupname 4096 ] folder1
│ ├── [-rw-r--r--] username groupname 1024 ] file1.txt
│ ├── [-rw-r--r--] username groupname 2048 ] file2.txt
│ └── [drwxr-xr-x] username groupname 4096 ] subfolder
│ └── [-rw-r--r--] username groupname 4096 ] file3.txt
└── [-rw-r--r--] username groupname 8192 ] file4.txt

2 directories, 4 files


## Implementation Details
The stree tool is implemented in C and uses various system libraries and functions to obtain file information and traverse the directory structure. Here are some key implementation details:

- The tool uses the `opendir` and `readdir` functions to open and read directories, respectively.
- It retrieves file information using the `stat` function and extracts file permissions, user and group names using the `getpwuid` and `getgrgid` functions.
- The tool prints the file tree recursively, incrementing the indentation level for each level of nested directories.
- Special characters, such as pipes (|) and dashes (-), are used to represent the tree structure visually.
- File sizes are displayed in a human-readable format, such as bytes, kilobytes, or megabytes, depending on the size.

## Build Instructions
To compile the stree tool, a Makefile is provided. Simply navigate to the directory containing the source code and the Makefile and run the following command: `make`
This will generate the executable file named `stree`.

To clean the directory and remove the generated executable, use the following command:`make clean`


## Limitations
- stree is designed to work on Linux systems, as it relies on Linux-specific file system functions and conventions.
- The tool does not currently support Windows systems due to differences in file system handling and permissions.
- File and directory names that contain special characters may not be displayed correctly in the tree structure.

## Conclusion
stree is a useful tool for visualizing and understanding the directory structure of a file system. It provides detailed information about file permissions, users, groups, and sizes, allowing users to gain insights into the file organization and hierarchy. By accurately representing the tree structure and employing clear formatting, stree enhances the readability and usability of the output.
